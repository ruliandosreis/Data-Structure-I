# Data Structure I

  On this repository, I added some algorithms I created when I was studying Data Structure on my current major, Computer Engineering.
At that time, I didn't knew how to use git, so all the files were uploaded from the GitHub app.

üè¥ All the algorithms had been built in C, the chosen language for the class

## Brief Summary

  The folders named as "EP{number}" were the main projects for the semester; The other folders, named as "miniEP{number}" were small activities that I'll not cover
below cause they had been used mostly as studying material.

### EP1
  The first main project was, given a image, apply some custom filters on it. This project covered dynamic allocation, where the images were stored in a structure that
  had the image height, it width and a "Pixel" matrix that stored the RGB levels of every pixel. When compiled, the main file opened on terminal a navigation where the 
  user could select witch filter them would apply, then, after selected, a new file with the filter applyed was saved on the user device.
  
  The logic involving the filters can be identified in the "Filtros.c" file. Highlight for Laplace edge detection filter and Sobel filter.
  
### EP2
  The second main project was, given a file filled with mathematical expressions, solve them using queue and stack structures. The main goal was get used to the structures
  and learn how to use them correctly
  
### EP3
  The last project, the hardest one, was a Spell Checker. Using a word database that was given by the professor, the words we're compared using Trees and queues structures.
  This project has a report written in portuguese in the file "Relat√≥rioEP3.pdf" so, for more details, check the file.
